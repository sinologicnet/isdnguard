<h1>ISDNGuard Failover Module for Asterisk</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is intended to serve as general support for maintaining res_isdnguard module 
watchdog signal generated by the serial port to enable failover system ports Junghanns ISDNGuard.

Junghanns stopped supporting failover ISDNGuard for their devices in Asterisk 1.6 and later, 
so we did a module compatible with Asterisk 1.8, Asterisk 10, 11 and 12 and we publish it here 
so that the community can continue its development if they desired.
