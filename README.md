<h1>ISDNGuard Failover module for Asterisk</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is intended to serve as general support for maintaining res_isdnguard module 
watchdog signal generated by the serial port to enable failover system ports Junghanns ISDNGuard.<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.junghanns.net/images/ISDNguard.jpg" />

Junghanns stopped supporting failover ISDNGuard for their devices in Asterisk 1.6 and later, 
so we did a module compatible with Asterisk 1.8, Asterisk 10, 11 and 12 and we publish it here 
so that the community can continue its development if they desired.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre>
    cd /usr/src/asterisk-xxx
    git clone https://github.com/sinologicnet/isdnguard
    cp isdnguard/res_isdnguard.c res/
    make
    make install
    ls -la res_isdnguard.so
</pre>
